#Iterators with Reddit

Similar to the Google Products lab, we'll be using a real data feed from the subreddit `/r/javascript`

You can view the live version here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript.json

## Write 4 styles of iterators

1. `forEach` -  `console.log` all titles
2. `map` - Return an array of permalinks, append `http://reddit.com` to each so that they contain full http:// path to reddit
3. `filter` - Filter the posts that contain actual text in the  `selftext` key
4. `reduce` - Use reduce to obtain the sum of all the `score` values across posts
